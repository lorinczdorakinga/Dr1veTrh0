# 🚗 Dr1veTrh0 - Fast Food, Faster Codes!

An interactive game for learning the binary numbers on your hands!

In Dr1ve Thr0, you’re not just serving fries — you’re **decoding** customer orders in binary (or decimal, depending on the mode) and passing them to the kitchen under tight time constraints. 
A car pulls up, a customer orders from the Daily Deals menu, and it’s your job to translate their order number into the correct format and validate it (sometimes with a wink! 😜). 
With multiple game modes and gesture-based controls, this game is as innovative as it is addictive.

🎮 **Game modes**
- Default: Convert order numbers to binary within 20 seconds.
- Double Trouble: Handle orders up to 1023 using two hands and validate with a wink!
- Reverse: Decode binary orders into decimal, also with two-hand gestures.
- Speedrun: Race against a 10-second timer for ultimate bragging rights.

🛠️ **How It Works**
Dr1ve Thr0 is built with PyQt6 for the GUI and OpenCV/MediaPipe for gesture recognition, split into two main components:

- Gesture Module: Handles hand detection and wink validation for inputting binary/decimal codes.
- Game Mechanics: Manages the drive-thru and kitchen scenes, timers, and order processing.

🚀 The game uses a Daily Deals panel with five menu items, each tied to a unique code. 
Players must match the customer’s order to its code and transmit it correctly within the time limit. 
High scores are saved per user, with a flashy yellow "New highscore reached!" message to celebrate your victories.

🤝 **Contributing**
We’d love for you to join the Dr1ve Thr0 crew! Whether it’s adding new game modes, improving gesture recognition, or fixing bugs, your contributions are welcome.
